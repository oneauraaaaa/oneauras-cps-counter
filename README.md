## **Summary**
A CPS counter mod that I made for the latest version of Minecraft 1.21.8, I would be really happy if you downloaded it, or contribute to the project via GitHub, anyways. Have a good day!

## **Config**
~~I am sorry for making you guys suffer but I was getting errors all the time and this is what I could do to add a config~~

In your .minecraft folder there will be a folder called "config" and inside that you should find a file named cpscounter.properties the file will be probably look like
```
position=TOP_LEFT
```
and there are 3 more positions you can change here is the code

```
position=TOP_RIGHT
```


```
position=BOTTOM_LEFT
```


```
position=BOTTOM_RIGHT
```


## **How the mod would look in game (top left)**
